Improved shell for ComputerCraft
--------------------------------

This is a more advanced version of the standard ComputerCraft shell application.

It's still in development, thus some functionality may be broken. Also because of this, the code may be messy in places.

Currently working features:

  - Autocompletion with Tab key
  - Most programs should run like in the normal CC shell

Planned features:

  - History (similar to how it works in the default shell)
  - History search (bash ctrl-r style)
  - Basic globbing
